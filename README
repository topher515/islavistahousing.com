This was the first site I ever built back in 2006! 
I'm uploading it now so I can keep it around.

It was supposed to help students find housing in the college town of 
Isla Vista which is directly adjacent to my alma mater, UC Santa Barbara

Please don't judge it too harshly. I learned a lot from the ol' girl.

Some hilarious mistakes off the top of my head:

 - store passwords in db as plaintext
 - literally the worst color scheme ever
